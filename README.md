# Ourchestra

## About
Ourchestra is a bot designed to play music based on user commands. It is currently hosted on the [Ourchestra Bot Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/ourchestra_bot).

Ourchestra uses the [FoxDot module for Python](https://foxdot.org/), which can be installed using `pip`, and consequently uses [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/download), currently at version 3.9.1.

It also requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/).

## Running

To run Ourchestra locally, you simply need to run

```$ python3 main.py```

and you're good to go. If everything is running correctly, this should start all the necessary modules and you should see the current ourchestra version on your console.

However, note that you need a Twitch channel to actually capture chat and stream your output.
